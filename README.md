## Overview
I've successfully designed the front-end of a QR code card using HTML and CSS. The card features a visually appealing layout achieved through effective styling and positioning. The use of CSS has allowed for precise control over elements, ensuring a polished and professional appearance.

## My process

First, I started with the structure, that's the html part .
And continued with the styling
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learn to use of css flex to arrange elements and going forward I will be experimenting it.
Also I used to center elements by writing more css codes, with the display grid property it was easy.
This is the code  

```html
<main class="container">
  <div class= "sub-container">
     <h1>Awesome work keep it up</h1>
  </div>
</main>
```
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  place-item: center;
  height: 100vh;
}

.sub-container{
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px
}
```


### Useful resources

- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This helped me for adding the box shadow. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
